/**
 * get_bit - Retrieves the value of a bit at a specified index in a decimal number.
 * @n: The decimal number from which to extract the bit.
 * @index: The index of the bit to retrieve (0 being the least significant bit).
 *
 * This function takes a decimal number and an index and returns the value of the
 * bit at the specified index. It first checks if the index is valid (less than or
 * equal to 63) and then extracts the bit by shifting the number to the right by the
 * index positions and using a bitwise AND operation to isolate the bit.
 *
 * @n: The decimal number from which the bit is extracted.
 * @index: The index of the bit to retrieve.
 *
 * Return: The value (0 or 1) of the bit at the specified index. If the index is
 *         out of range, it returns -1.
